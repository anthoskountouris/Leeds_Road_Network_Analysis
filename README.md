# Leeds Road Network Analysis and Marathon Planning

## Overview

This project focuses on the analysis of Leeds' road network and road events. Utilizing data from OpenStreetMap and datasets from road traffic accidents in Leeds, we delve into understanding the intricate spatial relationships and incident patterns on the city's roads.

## Datasets

- Road Network of Leeds: Available from OpenStreetMap.https://github.com/anthoskountouris/Leeds_Road_Network_Analysis/blob/main/README.md
- Road Traffic Accidents in Leeds: Data Source

## Task Breakdown:

### Task A: Spatial Networks and Planarity Analysis
- Choose an area of approx. 1 square kilometre around the centre of Leeds for in-depth analysis.
- Delve into characteristics such as spatial diameter, average street length, node density, intersection density, and edge density.
- Determine the average circuitry and its implications on road usage efficiency.
- Evaluate the planarity of the network.

### Task B: Road Accidents Analysis
- Visualize the distribution of road accidents aggregated over multiple years.
- Investigate the correlation between high-accident roads and their connecting roads.
- Analyze accident proximity to intersections vs mid-road locations.

### Task C: Marathon Route Planning using Voronoi Diagrams
- Strategize the initiation of 10 parallel marathons to maximize citywide participation.
- Determine and visualize Voronoi cells for initial seed points.
- Identify marathon paths of exactly 42 Km within cells.
- Explore potential solutions for cells without feasible marathon paths.

### Task D: Efficient Event Representation and Analysis
- Propose a representation method for crucial road network events, using the W3C PROV data model standard.
- Implement the PageRank algorithm to provide insights into event importance.
- Utilize TransE embeddings for detailed event relationship understanding and its potential applications.
